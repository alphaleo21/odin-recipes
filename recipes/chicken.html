    <img src="chicken.webp" alt="Finished Dish">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This meal is so comforting and family friendly. My kids eat every morsel on their plates. This is also a super economical way to feed a family or a large crowd. Great <br>
        served with green beans, broccoli, or a salad.</p>
    <h3>Ingredints</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>6 (4 ounce) bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>        
        <li>¾ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>⅔ cup finely chopped yellow onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups uncooked long-grain rice</li>
        <li>3 cups chicken stock, divided, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped flat-leaf parsley</li>
        <li>1 medium lemon, cut into wedges</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p> Heat oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Sprinkle chicken thighs evenly with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Place chicken skin-side down in the Dutch oven; cook undisturbed until golden crisp and easily released from<br>
         the bottom, about 5 minutes. Flip chicken and cook for 3 minutes more. Transfer to a plate and set aside. Chicken will not be cooked through at this point. </p>
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>Add butter to the drippings and melt. Add onion and cook, stirring often, until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add garlic; cook for 1 minute. Add rice; cook, stirring <br>
        to coat grains in drippings and lightly toast, about 1 minute. Stir in 3 cups stock and remaining salt and pepper. Bring to a boil. Use a wooden spoon to scrape any browned <br>
        bits from the bottom of the Dutch oven. Place the chicken thighs over the rice. </p>
    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven until all liquid has been absorbed and chicken is cooked through, 45 to 55 minutes. Add remaining stock if liquid is absorbed before rice and <br>
        chicken are cooked through. Sprinkle with parsley and squeeze lemon juice over the top. </p>
